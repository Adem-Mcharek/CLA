% Introduction and expression of interest
\lettercontent{Dear Hiring Manager,}

\lettercontent{I am writing to express my strong interest in the Summer Intern position at Osmo, a pioneering company digitizing the sense of smell with its proprietary technology, the Osmograph. With a robust academic background in Artificial Intelligence and extensive hands-on experience in AI research and software development, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Osmo's innovative work aimed at improving human health and wellbeing through olfaction.}

% Matching skills and experiences
\lettercontent{My proficiency in Python, machine learning, and software engineering acquired through projects like developing a PyTorch CNN for image classification and building a hand gesture recognition system using TensorFlow align well with the requirements for designing interfaces and APIs at Osmo to interact with scent data. Moreover, my background in neural networks and deep learning positions me to explore novel applications of datasets and build prototypes effectively.}

% Interest and qualifications alignment
\lettercontent{I am particularly drawn to Osmo's mission of giving computers a sense of smell and its focus on the intersection of software, molecular chemistry, and olfaction. My educational foundation in Artificial Intelligence, coupled with my practical experiences in AI research and data visualization, make me well-suited to contribute meaningfully to Osmo's projects. Furthermore, my passion for innovative technologies and dedication to continuous learning resonates with Osmo's culture of technical ingenuity and industry leadership.}
