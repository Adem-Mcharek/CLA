% Introduction and expression of interest
\lettercontent{Dear Hiring Manager,}

\lettercontent{I am writing to express my strong interest in the undergraduate internship opportunity at Intel's Wireless System Research (WSR) lab, specifically in the area of Wide Area Cloud (WAC) research, as outlined in the job description provided. As a motivated student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence at Long Island University, with a notable GPA of 3.88, and a solid foundation in various relevant courses including Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, and Data Mining, I am excited about the prospect of contributing to Intel's mission of creating world-changing technology through innovative research and development.}

\lettercontent{My experiences as an AI Research Assistant, where I orchestrated a multi-agent system for real-time academic literature retrieval and developed a PyTorch CNN for MNIST classification, have honed my programming skills and problem-solving abilities. Additionally, my project on Computer Vision using TensorFlow, achieving an 85% recall rate on a gesture recognition system, showcased my proficiency in deploying cutting-edge technologies to address real-world challenges.}

\lettercontent{I am particularly intrigued by Intel's focus on developing emerging WAC solutions to ensure end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) for users, which resonates with my academic background in artificial intelligence and cloud computing. I am keen to collaborate with Intel Labs researchers and internal product groups to innovate and transfer technologies that push the boundaries of communication and computing integration.}
